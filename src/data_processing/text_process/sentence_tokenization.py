        DIAGNOSES:  
        1.  Lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma involving bone marrow and spleen diagnosed  
        initially in [** Date **], associated with progressively increasing IgG kappa  
        paraprotein.  
        2.  Compression fractures of the spine secondary to lymphoma.  In the past,  
        it has been associated with significant back pain.  He is status post three  
        kyphoplasties.  The first in [** Date **] and two in [** Date **].  The first  
        procedure was complicated by acute hemoglobin decrease for which he was  
        hospitalized.  Hemorrhagic pericardial effusion was diagnosed and drained.  
        It was not malignant.  He received 5 units of red cells at that time.  
        2.  Extended hospitalization in [** Date **].  Then he was admitted for  
        significant back pain and then developed Salmonella sepsis with necrotizing  
        fasciitis of right gastrocnemius, which required debridement.  He had a  
        residual ulcer on the medial malleolus of the right ankle, which is now  
        fully healed.  He has required several hospitalizations for recurrent  
        cellulitis of right leg and most recently in [** Date **].  During the  
        prolonged hospitalization in [** Date **], he had respiratory arrest requiring  
        prolonged intubation and renal dialysis.  
        3.  Bilateral DVT with right leg DVT in [** Date **].  He finished 6-month  
        course of Coumadin after initially being treated with Lovenox.  
        4.  Psoriasis, which is quiescent.  
        5.  Hypertension.  
        6.  Hypothyroidism.  
        7.  Chronic renal insufficiency, which is multifactorial.  
          
        CURRENT THERAPY:  
        1.  He is on thalidomide 200 mg once daily for 2 weeks on and 2 weeks off.  
        He also takes prednisone 5 mg twice daily.  
        2.  Pamidronate 90 mg intravenously once a month.  
        3.  He has been on Velcade two weeks out of each month with reduced dosing  
        schedule of 1 mg/m2 once a week.  It was then discontinued secondary to  
        neuropathy.  It should be noted that did not respond to Velcade and  
        thalidomide.  
          
        PAST CHEMOTHERAPY:  
        1.  He has received 6 cycles of Rituxan plus CVP completed in [** Date **].  
        2.  Maintenance Rituxan completed in [** Date **].  
        3.  Revlimid, which was discontinued secondary to skin rash.  
        4.  Fludarabine in [** Date **], which rendered him profoundly  
        pancytopenic.  
          
        ADDITIONAL MEDICATIONS:  MS Contin 15 mg p.o. b.i.d., MSIR 30 mg every 4  
        hours for breakthrough pain.  Cartia XT, doxazosin, Protonix, Lasix,  
        Levoxyl, multivitamins and Neurontin 200 mg b.i.d.  He received his refills  
        for MS Contin and MSIR today.  
          
        INTERIM HISTORY:  Mr. [** Name **] returns for followup of his lymphoma.  He  
        recently sustained a fall secondary to slipping on ice.  He hurt his lower  
        back and has moderate, 4/10 back pain.  He is currently on MS Contin and  
        MSIR with relief of his symptoms.  He continues to have neuropathy from  
        Velcade, which is relieved with Neurontin 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.  He also has  
        constipation and is taking Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. with relief of  
        symptoms.  
          
        He is also being followed by endocrinology for weight gain.  He has low  
        testosterone levels and has been started on replacement over the last 10  
        days.  
          
        REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He denies any history of fevers, night sweats, chills,  
        headache or visual blurring.  He denies any chest pain, cough, dyspnea,  
        orthopnea and no peripheral edema.  He denies any abdominal pain, nausea or  
        vomiting.  He has constipation.  He denies any episodes of diarrhea, bright  
        red blood per rectum or melena.  He has significant peripheral neuropathy  
        secondary to Velcade and is on Neurontin.  
          
        FAMILY HISTORY:  Acute leukemia in his father.  His father also had bladder  
        cancer.  He has one sibling who is not HLA match.  He has no family history  
        of lymphoma or multiple myeloma.  
          
        His ECOG performance status is 1, which is unchanged.  He is limited due to  
        back pain and cannot stand for prolonged periods of time.  He, however,  
        lives independently and is independent with all ADLs.  
          
        PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  
        GENERAL:  He is alert and oriented x3.  
        VITAL SIGNS:  Stable.  Temperature 98.3, pulse 72, blood pressure 140/90,  
        respiratory rate 16 and weight is 117 kilograms.  No cervical,  
        supraclavicular or axillary lymphadenopathy.  
        LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  
        CARDIOVASCULAR:  S1, S2 present, no murmurs.  
        ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender and nondistended.  Good bowel sounds.  No  
        hepatosplenomegaly is palpable.  
        EXTREMITIES:  There is 2+ peripheral edema.  He is wearing compression  
        stocking on the right leg.  
        NEUROLOGICAL:  Nonfocal.  His gait is abnormal secondary to pain.  
          
        LABORATORY DATA:  WBC 3.7, hemoglobin 12.4, hematocrit 36.2, platelet count  
        is 143,000, BUN is 22, creatinine is 1.35, calcium is 9.4, kappa 328.39,  
        lambda light chain 1.46, ratio 224.92,  
        IgG 3580, which has increased from before.  
          
        ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Mr. [** Name **] is a 53-year-old male with  
        lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma that is acting more like multiple myeloma and  
        affecting his bones.  His disease is currently stable.  He was better  
        controlled on Velcade, but developed significant peripheral neuropathy.  He  
        is getting better with Neurontin.  
          
        The patient is worried about losing his long-term disability.  He is unable  
        to stand for prolonged period of time and would like to return to work but  
        is unable to.  He will continue to receive Zometa once monthly.  He will  
        continue on thalidomide 100 mg once daily, 2 weeks on and 2 weeks off.  He  
        will also continue prednisone 5 mg twice daily.  
          
        He will follow up with Dr. [** Name **] at [** Hospital **].  He is  
        not a transplant candidate because his disease is minimally responsive to  
        chemotherapy.  He would be a good candidate for clinical trials.  
          
        He will follow up with us in 1 month.  
          
          
          
        I saw and evaluated the patient.  I discussed the case with the fellow and  
        agree with the findings and plan as documented in the fellow's note.

TITLE:\n   67 y.o.m. with metastatic renal cell carcinoma with metastasis to the\n   pancreas and liver as well as known duodenal/ampullary mass presents\n   with BRBPR x 2 days. Of note, the patient was recently started on\n   sutent. Pt states that he first noticed bloody bowel movement yesterday\n   am. He called his oncologist who recommended bowel prep in anticipation\n   of colonoscopy today given known side effect of bleeding with sutent.\n   Pt has colonoscopy this am that showed blood in colon but no\n   identifiable source. Pt was referred to the ED for tagged RBC scan and\n   labs.\n   Here, a tagged RBC scan was positive at 60 min, and pt was taken to\n   angiography.
